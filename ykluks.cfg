# Set this to "password" if you want to use 1FA (one-factor authentication), 
# which checks for the paired Yubikey's presence---but does not prompt for a 
# password, interactively. If the Yubikey is removed, the password prompt 
# is displayed and will unlock if one of the LUKS slots is using that as 
# a normal password. This is weaker than 2-factor authentication, but allows 
# for an unattended boot so long as the Yubikey is present.
