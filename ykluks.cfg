# Set this to a previously-enrolled challenge password if you want to use 1FA 
# (one-factor authentication), which checks for the paired Yubikey's presence.
# This will suppress the interactive prompt for the password during boot time.
# If the Yubikey is not presetnt at boot time, then the password prompt 
# is displayed and will unlock if one of the LUKS slots is using that as 
# a normal password. This is weaker than 2-factor authentication, but allows 
# for an unattended boot so long as the Yubikey is present.
# Leave this empty (or unset), if you want to do 2FA -- i.e. being asked for the password during boot time.
